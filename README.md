## Oracle

`Important Note`: This is currently very WIP.
This design system is intended to be opinionated, and focused on the kinds of work that Collab vision - my other appp - does (building application).

## Purpose

- Learn about design systems XD.
- Build a design system focused on accessibility

## Fun fact

In 2020 I was working on a css library called Dracula UI - inspired by the popularity of the dracula ui theme - but after a while the theme creator started a UI project called dracula ui so I had to change the name. I love the simplicity of tailwind and the accessibility of chakra ui, so I started this project by trying to blend the two. I hope to succeed.
